So this is a very basic and boring web app that tells you whether or not a number is prime. However, it does meet most of the requirements for the program (or atleast the ones I understood.) The only features I'm missing are the stylesheet and consuming information from a web server. It also has no error checking because time has been a huge issue and I barely got what I have now done.

Here are the features/ how to use it:
-Can be run through a web browser or through a terminal
-Can submit the number through the submit box or via querystring
-QUERYSTRING format is ?num="your number here"
-Can check primes upto 15485863
